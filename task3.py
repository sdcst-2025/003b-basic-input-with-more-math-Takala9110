##### Task 3
When shopping, we pay 12% combined GST and PST on many items.  Write a program that asks the user to enter in the prices of 4 items that they are buying.  Find the total price, the amount of tax and the overall price.  Taxes are rounded appropriately

example:
Enter the first price: 11.99
Enter the second price: 14.76
Enter the third price: 12.99
Enter the fourth price: 15.98
Enter the fift price: 7.99
Your subtotal is $63.71 and your taxes total $7.65 for a total of $71.36

"""

price1 = input("Enter the first price:")
price2 = input("Enter the second price:")
price3 = input("Enter the third price:")
price4 = input("Enter the fourth price:")
price5 = input("Enter the fith price:")

price1 = float(price1)
price2 = float(price2)
price3 = float(price3)
price4 = float(price4)
price5 = float(price5) 

total = price1+price2+price3+price4+price5
taxtotal = total*0.12
taxtotal = round(taxtotal, 2)
finaltotal = total + taxtotal
print(f"Your subtotal will be ${total} and your tax total is ${taxtotal} for a total of ${finaltotal}")
